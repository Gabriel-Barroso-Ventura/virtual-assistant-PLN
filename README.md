# Personal Assistant with Natural Language Processing

In this project, we created a Python script that acts as a virtual assistant with the help of NLP (Natural Language Processing) techniques. It identifies voice commands to perform tasks.

Four tasks were implemented:

- Search for a topic on Wikipedia;
   
- Search for nearby pharmacies;
   
- Open YouTube;

- End the Script.
